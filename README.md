# Course Description

> Project course in which students work as leaders or members of project teams.
> Individual oral presentations and written reports.
> Overview of applicable discrete and stochastic foundations: combinatorics, probability, and Monte Carlo.
> Introduction to modeling formalism with examples from numerical and logical processes.
> Simulation languages such as R are demonstrated.
> Student projects entail simulations of physical or social science problems.
> Emphasis on student presentations with statistical analysis and visual summaries.

The course can be thought of having three phases.
The first phase comprises an introduction to the mathematical foundations of probability theory.
Here students are introduced to concepts relavent in the application of probablity theory in computer science.
These concepts will be reienforce through mathematical homework assignments and this phase will conclude with the first midterm.
The second phase builds upon the concepts of the first by introducing many common probability distributions.
Students gain an understanding as to when different distributions relate to real world phenomona.
This understanding will be gained through working with distributions in homework programming assignments.
The second phase concludes with the second midterm.
The final phase consists of a group project applying the techniques developed in the prior two phases.

As the course progresses throughout the semester, the three phases of the course transition from pure mathematical theory to the technical practice of programming.
The table below loosely conceptualizes the transitionary structure of the course.

| **Phase**        | Theory | Practice |
|:-----------------|:------:|:--------:|
|  Foundations     | $1$ | $0$ |
|  Distributions   | $\frac{1}{2}$ | $\frac{1}{2}$ |
|  Actualizations  | $0$ | $0$ |

There will be a group project during the last third of the semester, comprising five weeks.
The group project can be subdivided into three phases:

 1. **Planning** *(1 week)*
    - Students will be organized into project teams
    - Teams will develop and present a project proposal
    - Students will pitch potential project ideas for the semester

 2. **Development** *(3 week)*
    - Each week on *Tuesdays:*
        - The scheduled class period will be reserved for teams to collaborate independently
        - The instructor will be available during the scheduled class period for consultation on technical difficulties with projects
        - The instructor will *also* be available during office hours immediately *after* the scheduled class period
    - Each week on *Thursdays:*
        - Each team member will present their *completed* contibutions to the project since the *last* week
        - Each team member will present their *planned*   contibutions to the project for   the *next* week
        - Teams will have an opportunity to ask questions and solicit feedback from the instructor and their peers in other teams regarding issues with their project

 2. **Conclusion** *(1 week)*
    - Teams will present their Project Presentation at the end of December
        - Teams must submit a script / slides of their presentation *before* class begins on 12/14
        - Each team member must present an aspect of the project
        - The presentation should demonstrate the final and complete functionality of the project
    - Team members will submit a confidential Peer Comment survey describing thier experiance working with thier peers.


### Project Reporting

Each week students will report on the progress of their product. *Each* student is expected to report on the contributions they made since the *last* product report, and state their planned contributions to complete for the *next* project report. After team members have reported on their recent and tenetive contributions, the floor will be opened up for any team member to solicit assistance or feedback on one or more technical issues they are experiencing. The instructor or their peers will attempt to provide them with assistance addressing their issue(s). Students who can provide guidance to members of another tem will be given additional consideration on their project reporting for that week.








# Standard Information


## Email 

Emails to the instructor must be from a student's CUNY Hunter College email address to the instructor's CUNY email address [aw2918@hunter.cuny.edu][email] for [FERPA reasons](#family-educational-rights-and-privacy-act-ferpa).

## Academic Violations

Hunter College regards acts of academic dishonesty (e.g., plagiarism, cheating on examinations, obtaining unfair advantage, and falsification of records and official documents) as serious offenses against the values of intellectual honesty. The college is committed to enforcing the CUNY Policy on Academic Integrity and will pursue cases of academic dishonesty according to the Hunter College Academic Integrity Procedures.
Special attention is given to CONTRACT CHEATING (this is where students have work completed on their behalf which is then submitted for academic credit).

## Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) 

The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) ([20 U.S.C. § 1232g; 34 CFR Part 99][ferpa-law]) is a Federal law that protects the privacy of student education records. The law applies to all schools that receive funds under an applicable program of the U.S. Department of Education.

FERPA gives parents certain rights with respect to their children's education records. These rights transfer to the student when he or she reaches the age of 18 or attends a school beyond the high school level. Students to whom the rights have transferred are "eligible students."

- Parents or eligible students have the right to inspect and review the student's education records maintained by the school. Schools are not required to provide copies of records unless, for reasons such as great distance, it is impossible for parents or eligible students to review the records. Schools may charge a fee for copies.
- Parents or eligible students have the right to request that a school correct records which they believe to be inaccurate or misleading. If the school decides not to amend the record, the parent or eligible student then has the right to a formal hearing.
After the hearing, if the school still decides not to amend the record, the parent or eligible student has the right to place a statement with the record setting forth his or her view about the contested information.
- Generally, schools must have written permission from the parent or eligible student in order to release any information from a student's education record. However, FERPA allows schools to disclose those records, without consent, to the following parties or under the following conditions ([34 CFR § 99.31][ferpa-law-consent]):
    - School officials with legitimate educational interest;
    - Other schools to which a student is transferring;
    - Specified officials for audit or evaluation purposes;
    - Appropriate parties in connection with financial aid to a student;
    - Organizations conducting certain studies for or on behalf of the school;
    - Accrediting organizations;
    - To comply with a judicial order or lawfully issued subpoena; 
    - Appropriate officials in cases of health and safety emergencies; and
    - State and local authorities, within a juvenile justice system, pursuant to specific State law.

Schools may disclose, without consent, "directory" information such as a student's name, address, telephone number, date and place of birth, honors and awards, and dates of attendance. However, schools must tell parents and eligible students about directory information and allow parents and eligible students a reasonable amount of time to request that the school not disclose directory information about them. Schools must notify parents and eligible students annually of their rights under FERPA. The actual means of notification (special letter, inclusion in a PTA bulletin, student handbook, or newspaper article) is left to the discretion of each school.
